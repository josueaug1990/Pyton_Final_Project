# Pyton_Final_Project
THis project was a based-text game that was about of an adventurer whose mission was to rescue his princess. He started his journey with a quantified life (points).
The adventurer can be randomly attacked by three different types of enemies. Depending on the enemy attacking him, he is going to loose a different number of points.
If after ten steps his life is greater than zero, he wins and his princess is rescued. But if at any time down the road, the adventurer's life is less than zero, 
he loses, and he fails to rescue his princess.
